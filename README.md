## sqlInjection

This demo was created for a new student orientation. Just
a simple lesson to teach basic sqlInjection and what it
can allow users to accomplish. Goal is to be able to gain
access into the system, then dump data of all the users in
the database.

#### Pre-requisites

* mysql
* web server
* php

#### Set-up

Set up your web server so that the files for this demo are in 
the directory the web server has access to. Either change the
directory in the server's configuration or place the files in
the default directory.

Next, run `setup.sh` as this will create and set-up an example
mysql databse. Once that is done, start your web server and 
visit your web page to test it out!
